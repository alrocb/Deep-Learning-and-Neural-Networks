        "The key idea is that we will define our own class of `Variable` which is basically the same as a scalar (a number). So our class is created by passing it a `value`, and it stores this value internally.\n",

        "But apart from being a placeholder for a number, we also want to keep track of the way every variable was created.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a variable $c$ is the result of the addition of two variables $a$ and $b$: $c = a + b$, then we would say that $a$ and $b$ are \"parent\" variables of $c$, and $c$ is their \"child\". The way $c$ was created was by adding these two parent variables together.\n",
        "\n",
        "So apart from the value of the variable, we will also have to keep track of the parents, and on how each of them \"contributes\" to the creation of the variable - this is described by the local derivative associated with each of the parents, that tells us how a change in each of the parent variables translates into a change in the child variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is important in order to implement our backwards pass. Each parent defines a \"route\" through which the gradients coming into this variable will have to flow through. So we will define a list of `gradRoutes` that will contain the list of parent variables and their corresponding local derivatives. A variable created directly (not resulting by any operation over existing variables) will have an empty `gradRoutes`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we want each variable of ours to keep also the value of gradient of the quantity we are interested in with respect to that variable. We will create a placeholder for that as well, called `grad`. As seen before, this will accummulate the gradients that are backpropagated from the children of this variable when we implement the backpropagation algorithm. So we will initialise it to zero."
